# Personal Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio website. It’s a clean, modern front-end project used to showcase my work, background, and selected projects.

The goal of the site is to be clear, fast, and easy to maintain. There’s no unnecessary complexity, just a solid structure that can grow over time as new work is added.
